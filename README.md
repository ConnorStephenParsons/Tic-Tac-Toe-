# Tic-Tac-Toe-
I have created a Tic, Tac, Toe game which can be played within python IDE. Plese save it as TicTacToe.py, download python 3 IDE, then type into the command line Python3 TicTacToe.py to start plaing the game. Great for people who are just starting to use python and want to understand classes, loops, conditional statements and the syntax with a simple game.
